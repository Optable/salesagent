# TODO

Security and permissions
- [DONE] Add an admin token so that an admin user can see additional tools

Functionality
Note: with all of these we should update the overall AdCP Sales Agent spec that is in docs-adcp as well as making the changes locally.
- [DONE] look into creative grouping across ad servers and consider adding a creative group hierarchy layer
- [DONE] add a "get creatives" call that can show all active creatives, potentially limited to a creative group if we go that route
- [DONE] add a mechanism for an admin to see pending creatives and approve them
- [DONE] we need to mark targeting features as managed-only vs available in an overlay. For instance key-value targeting should not be externally available, but orchestrator should be able to specifically target AEE signals.

Adapters
- [DONE] Have the default creative engine be configurable to allow certain formats (generally the standard ones) be auto-approved vs pending.
- Add an adapter for Xandr/Microsoft Monetize as an ad server
- [DONE] Make sure that all adapters are adding key-val pairs for AEE signal integration properly and have AEE signals as a primary capability

Agent vs human config
- [DONE] We should allow some capabilities of an adapter are provided by a human. For instance, I could set up GAM to allow the agent to read objects and run reports, but require a human to make changes. This should be done at the overall agent level. There should be a task queue that Admin users can see like "Principal Nike requests Media Buy 1234 have daily pacing updated to $1023".
- [DONE] The orchestrator should not know a human is doing things, so we should in general have the concept for all CRUD requests that they may be asynchronous. The orchestrator should generally assume that they submit requests and then check for completion, and they should be able to query "open requests" and see what their status is.
- [DONE] The AI should be able to check task completion for the user, so if a request is like "update media buy daily budget to $100/day" it should be able to query the media buy and see what the daily budget is, and if it's not $100/day, it should show the task as incomplete. An admin should be able to call "mark_task_complete XYZ" and the AI should double check it, basically (which the human should be able to override)
- Add Slack integration for notifications of new tasks and potentially for approval of them

Creative macros for AEE
- Add a third provided signal category for "creative macros" that will fill out a macro provided in the creative. This could be used for DCO, for measurement, etc

Log level data or automated reporting for AEE


Targeting:
We need to articulate which targeting dimensions are available by channel in the AdCP spec for targeting overlay, which won't be the full set available in the ad server. This is because 1) publishers will want to generally bundle many of these capabilities in their media products and 2) buyers can do most of their own targeting via AEE without pushing it to the pub.
So we should specify for each channel (audio, web, mobile app, CTV, DOOH):
- Which dimensions should the publisher make available for targeting_overlays
  * All channels should support dayparting based on the user's timezone
  * All channels should support browser, device, OS, and language when available
  * All channels should have country, region, metro, and city available for targeting
  * All channels should provide all user IDs that they have available
  * Audio and CTV should provide genre, rating, content duration, station/channel
- Which dimensions should the publisher make available via AEE
  * All of the above targeting fields should be passed via AEE
  * All channels should provide the user's timezone for dayparting support via AEE
  * All channels should have postal_code, postal_district, and lat/long available via AEE when available
  * Audio should provide the podcast episode ID (GUID) when available
  * CTV may provide the show name and metaata when available
  * CTV should provide all content IDs (ie IRIS, Gracenote) for the current show
  * Web should provide the URL for the current page and optionally a list of each adjacent article to an ad
  * Web should provide the ad slot or global placement ID (GPID) for each placement on the page
  * Mobile app should provide the URL for any content that is also available on the web, or an equivalent content ID for adjacent content

We should also make it clear how a publisher can share which dimensions they support - for instance, an orchestrator should be able to ask "do you support RampID or CoreID for AEE" and get a response. A media buy should specify which dimensions it requires for AEE and if those aren't available, the buy should be rejected.


Creative adaptation
- Right now this is the buyer calling an "adapt creative" endpoint from the seller. I think actually it should be part of the add creative process where the publisher can respond with suggested changes or variants, and the buyer can approve them or not. So it is a step in the process not a separate tool.
