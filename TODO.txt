- Build a Google Ad Manager adapter
- Rename this project "AdCP Sales Agent" and use that terminology throughout
- Implement a test suite that can be used to validate a new ad server adapter (that should pass for the mock ad server and the GAM one)
- Implement token-based authentication (supported by FastMCP) and add the concept of a "principal" that would get different pricing, see different media buys, etc. This would correlate to an advertiser in GAM (I think)
- Implement admin tools so that the publisher can easily see and debug what proposals are coming in and out, and follow along as things are happening
- Implement production features like logging and metrics
